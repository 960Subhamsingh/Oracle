AND (to check for both conditions to be true)
OR (to check for one of the conditions to be true)
 Between (selects for a given range)
In (matches any value in the list)
NOT (to negate the given condition)

Order By Clause
To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC)
Aggregate Functions
Aggregare functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value.
COUNT( )
MAX( )
MIN( )
SUM( )
AVG( )

Group By Clause
Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
It collects data from multiple records and groups the result by one or more column.
*Generally we use group by with some aggregation function

Having Clause
Similar to Where i.e. applies some condition on rows.
Used when we want to apply any condition after grouping.
Count number of students in each city where max marks cross 90.

select count(name), city from student group by city having max(marks) >90;
General Order
SELECT column(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column(s) ASC

Cascading for FK

On Delete Cascade
When we create a foreign key using this option, it deletes the referencing rows in the child table
when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key.

On Update Cascade 
When we create a foreign key using UPDATE CASCADE the referencing rows are updated in the child
table when the referenced row is updated in the parent table which has a primary key.

create table student(
id int primary key,
course_id int,
foreign key(course_id) references course(id)
on delete cascade
on delete cascade
);


Joins in SQL
Join is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Returns records that have matching values in both tables
Syntax
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
INNER JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;

Left Join
Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from
the right table
Syntax
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
LEFT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;

Right Join
Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records
from the left table
Syntax
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
RIGHT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name

Full Join
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table


Union
It is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
Gives UNIQUE records.
Syntax
SELECT column(s) FROM tableA
UNION
SELECT column(s) FROM tableB

SQL Sub Queries
A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query.
Query
Sub Query
It involves 2 select statements.
Syntax
SELECT column(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE col_name operator
( subquery );


A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

create view view1 as select  rollno, name from student;

select * from view1;

*A view always shows up-to-date data. The
database engine recreates the view, every time a
user queries it.
