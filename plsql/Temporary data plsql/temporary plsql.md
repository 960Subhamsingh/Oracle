a temporary table is a special type of table that stores data temporarily during a session or transaction. Unlike regular tables, the data in temporary tables is private to the session and is automatically deleted at the end of the session or transaction, depending on how the temporary table is defined.

Types of Temporary Tables
Global Temporary Tables (GTT):
Data is visible only to the session that inserts it.
The data can persist for the duration of the session or transaction, depending on how the table is created.
Creating a Global Temporary Table
To create a global temporary table, you use the CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement. Here’s the syntax:

sql
Copy code
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
) ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;  -- or ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS: Data remains in the table until the session ends.
ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS: Data is deleted after each transaction.
Example of Creating and Using a Temporary Table
Here’s an example that demonstrates creating a global temporary table, inserting data, and retrieving it:

sql
Copy code
-- Create the global temporary table
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp_employees (
    employee_id NUMBER,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50)
) ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;
/

-- PL/SQL block to insert and retrieve data
DECLARE
    v_full_name VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
    -- Insert data into the temporary table
    INSERT INTO temp_employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe');

    INSERT INTO temp_employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith');

    -- Retrieve and display the data
    FOR rec IN (SELECT * FROM temp_employees) LOOP
        v_full_name := rec.first_name || ' ' || rec.last_name;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee: ' || v_full_name);
    END LOOP;
END;

Key Points About Temporary Tables
Session-Specific: Each session has its own instance of the temporary table, and data is not shared between sessions.
Performance: Temporary tables can improve performance by storing intermediate results that do not need to be stored permanently.
Automatic Cleanup: Depending on the definition, data can be automatically cleaned up at the end of a transaction or session.
Usage: Temporary tables are often used for complex data manipulations, reporting, or bulk operations where data does not need to be retained.
Dropping a Temporary Table
If you need to remove a temporary table, you can do so using the DROP TABLE statement:



DROP TABLE temp_employees;

Summary

Global Temporary Tables are used to store temporary data specific to a session or transaction.
Data can persist until the session ends or be deleted after each transaction.
They are useful for performance optimization and managing intermediate data in PL/SQL operations.
